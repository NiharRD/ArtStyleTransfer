### Form

The artwork contains several irregular organic blobs forming the main figure’s head and body, all of which are two-dimensional outlines. The background includes wavy lines representing the sky and water, also in two-dimensional shapes with softly rounded edges. The railing appears as a series of long rectangles with sharp straight edges. All shapes are opaque.

### Composition

The layout is asymmetrical. The primary focal point is the central figure, located at approximately 35% from the left and 70% from the top. The composition is balanced by the weight of the central figure against the distant figures on the left. There is a flowing Z-shaped reading path from the top-left to the bottom right. Negative space is minimal, confined mostly to the areas around the central figure and the sky.

### Material

The artwork is oil paint on cardboard. The surface has a matte feel, with visible brushstrokes that create a textured effect.

### Technique

The paint application is in a layered, loose gestural style, allowing the brushstrokes to be prominent. It uses layered glazing for the sky and water areas.

### Color

The sky is painted with vivid swathes of red, orange, and yellow at the top to create a dramatic effect, transitioning to deep blue and purple in the background representing water. The central figure's head is painted in a pale ochre, contrasting with the darker tones of blue and brown on the body. The railing is painted in brown tones with alternating shadows of deep blue. The ground surface incorporates browns, blacks, and hints of red.

### Line

The lines are continuous and heavy in weight, often exceeding 8 px, to outline contours and internal details. The lines create a sense of fluidity and motion, particularly in the sky and river, with predominant horizontal and curved directions.

### Perspective

The artwork utilizes an atmospheric perspective, with fog and mist implied to create depth. The vanishing point is suggested by the lines of the railing extending toward the left background. The horizon line is placed at approximately 40% of the frame height.

### Space

The spatial feel is deep, with an impression of more than 5 meters created by perspective lines and the receding figures. The space is segmented, with the central figure in the foreground and the landscape in the background. The viewer's position is at eye level.

### Proportion

The figures in the foreground are disproportionate, with the head of the central figure larger relative to its body, emphasizing its expression. Ratios are not naturalistic, deliberately distorted for effect.

### Scale

The original canvas size is 91 cm by 73.5 cm. The main figure occupies about 70% of the height. The artwork is human-scale.

### Texture

The brushwork creates an implied texture on the water and sky, with a grainy feel due to the visible brushstrokes, while the central figure has smoother textures due to less detailed execution. The visible texture enhances the emotional intensity and drama of the scene.
