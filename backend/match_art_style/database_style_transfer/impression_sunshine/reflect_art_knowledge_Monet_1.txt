### Form

- Central object: irregular organic blob shaped like a boat, fully three-dimensional, opaque.
- Five human figures: three-dimensional, opaque; various shapes including cylindrical (torso), conical (head), and irregular parts for limbs.
- Ocean surface: irregular organic forms, 2-D outlines and some 3-D volumetric waves, edges softly rounded.

### Composition

- Layout type: asymmetrical.
- Primary focal point: central figure at 50% width, 50% height.
- Balance method: heavier left side due to figures, lighter right due to open water.
- Directional flow: downward diagonal from top-left to bottom-right, following the boat and figures.
- Negative space: ocean occupies approximately 40% of the frame beneath the figures.

### Material

- Medium: oil paint on canvas.
- Surface feel: matte with slight texture from brushwork.
- Visible artifacts: soft visible brushstrokes, no clear lines typical of impasto.

### Technique

- Application style: layered glazing with varying thickness.
- Precision level: loose gestural for figures, more precise on boat and water details.
- Special process: blending for smoother transitions in sky and water.

### Color

- Sky: various shades of gray (light gray at the top, transitioning to darker gray near the horizon).
- Water: blue with hints of gray, near the boat appearing more turbulent with darker blue tones.
- Boat: brown, darker near the waterline, with highlights suggesting a polished surface.
- Figures: skin tones primarily dark brown, clothes in bright colors (orange for one figure, red for another, blue for one wearing a hat, and gray for another), creating contrast against the muted background.

### Line

- Line types: continuous for figure outlines, and slightly irregular for the boat shape.
- Weight: medium (3-5 px) for figures, heavier on the boat outline (>8 px).
- Function: outline contours of figures and boat, internal detail suggested in clothing folds.
- Direction: mostly vertical and horizontal lines in figures, curved lines in the ocean.

### Perspective

- Perspective type: atmospheric fade with low depth.
- Vanishing points: not clearly defined in the artwork; suggestive of horizon line at water level.
- Degree of foreshortening: minimal on figures but noticeable in the boat's angle.
- Horizon line height: approximately 40% of frame height.

### Space

- Depth range: shallow impression (<20 cm).
- Spatial continuity: uninterrupted between figures and ocean.
- Viewer position: eye-level perspective.

### Proportion

- Head to body ratio: heads approximately 1:4 of full figure height.
- Idealized proportions: slightly exaggerated for emphasis on clothing and gestures.

### Scale

- Overall canvas size: approximately 100 cm × 70 cm.
- Relative scale of main subject to canvas: figures fill about 60% height of the canvas.
- Human-scale: viewers can relate to the size of the figures.

### Texture

- Real texture: smooth areas on the boat, rough texture in ocean waves.
- Implied texture: soft waves depicted with a blend of color suggesting motion.
- Pattern size: wave patterns within 5 px variation.
- Purpose: rough texture to signify the movement of water, smooth for the boat's surface.
