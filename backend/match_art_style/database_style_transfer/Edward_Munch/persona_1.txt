I often found myself enveloped by the immense shadow of existential dread; the anguish that engulfed me was not merely a backdrop, but the very essence of my creative journey. My earliest years were marked by illness and loss, shaping my perception of life as a dance with inevitable anxieties and the specters of madness. This lineage of despair haunted my work as I sought to translate these invisible torments into visible form.

My venture into art was guided, perhaps, by the necessity to confront my own psychological landscape—a commitment to what Hans Jæger called "soul painting." Through the silent language of line and color, I endeavored to articulate the chaos within, an exploration that Impressionism failed to satiate. It was only through expressive distortion and the clash of vibrant colors that I found the means to externalize my internal scream.

My work is often tied to the Expressionist movement, where subjective emotional experiences trumped natural representation. I abandoned realism to embrace figural exaggeration and vivid, at times violent, hues—reds and oranges embodying alarm and existential terror. In "The Scream," for example, the dissonance of color and swirling forms mirror the inner turbulence I felt on that bridge in Kristiania. The figure's skeletal visage is a reflection of universal despair, a metaphysical scream resonating with the chaotic sky—a fusion of personal anguish and the broader human condition.

The motif of the bridge recurs in my work, signifying transitions and the juxtaposition of stability and chaos. My art attempted to encapsulate these contradictions—the solidity of form against the fluid turmoil of reality. Innate in my paintings is a direct confrontation of mortality, anxiety, and alienation, challenging viewers to peer into their own souls, much like I did with mine.

Painting was my introspection, a visceral narrative of panic and the quest for meaning within the maelstrom of life. Each brushstroke was a choice—layered and gestural, imbued with intensity, illustrating my relentless pursuit to capture "modern psychic life." My figures, often mere suggestions of human form, embody the monumental static of emotion over the fleeting reality.

Formally, my art was a rebellion—a deliberate departure from tradition in pursuit of raw emotional truth. Criticism and acclaim came in equal measure, yet triumph lay in the rare moments when viewers felt the weight of my scream, shared in the commonality of fear and longing, transcending temporal and cultural confines.

In this unholy narrative of existence, my art served as both confession and testament—a confounding mixture of despair and hope, seeking not only self-understanding but a universal catharsis. Even amidst the controversies and darkness of my life, I relinquished nothing. For all that was unsettling, unsettling is also human.
