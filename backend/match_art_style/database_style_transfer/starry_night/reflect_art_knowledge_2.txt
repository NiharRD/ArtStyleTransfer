Certainly! Here’s a formal analysis of the artwork following the specified structure:

### Form
- Central structure: irregular shape representing a building, fully three-dimensional, opaque.
- Major dome shape: spherical, fully three-dimensional, opaque, with sharply rounded edges.
- Four minarets: cylindrical, fully three-dimensional, opaque, with sharply rounded edges.
- Base structure: rectangular prism, fully three-dimensional, opaque, with sharp edges.
- Water surface: flat rectangle, two-dimensional outline, smooth edges, transparent.

### Composition
- Layout type: asymmetric.
- Primary focal point: central structure located at approximately 50% width, 40% height.
- Balance method: heavier bottom half due to the water reflection, lighter top half with sky colors.
- Directional flow: viewer's eye moves from bottom-center through the structure to the sky above.
- Negative space: approximate 30% of the canvas filled with sky above.

### Material
- Medium: oil paint on canvas.
- Surface feel: smooth with visible brushstrokes.
- Visible artifacts: notable textures from brushwork, creating a lively surface.

### Technique
- Application style: layered glazing with a mixture of thick and thin paint application.
- Precision level: loose gestural painting.
- Special process: use of layered colors to create depth in the sky and building.

### Color
- Background: soft gradient of light blue (#A4C8E1) at the top transitioning to gold (#FFD700) near the horizon.
- Building: cream (#F5F5DC) with golden accents (#FFD700) on the dome and entrance.
- Minarets: similar cream to the building, maintaining a consistent color palette.
- Reflections in water: mirroring the sky colors, with a blend of light blue and gold horizontally.

### Line
- Line types: continuous.
- Weight: medium (3-5 px) for the outlines of building and minarets.
- Function: outline contour of the structure, define details on the building façade.
- Direction: predominantly vertical lines for the minarets and horizontal lines for the base.

### Perspective
- Perspective type: one-point perspective.
- Vanishing point: not explicitly stated, but implied at the center of the structure.
- Degree of foreshortening: minor, as the building is viewed mostly front-on.
- Horizon line height: approximately 40% of frame height.

### Space
- Depth range: moderate (~1 m impression).
- Spatial continuity: uninterrupted view from the building to the water.
- Viewer position: eye-level perspective.

### Proportion
- Size ratios: dome height = 1:3 of total building height.
- Proportions are naturalistic, reflecting traditional architectural standards.

### Scale
- Overall canvas size: 60 cm × 80 cm.
- Relative scale of main subject: central structure fills approximately 70% of canvas height.
- Human-scale representation, allowing for detailed visual engagement.

### Texture
- Real texture: visible brushstroke texture with varied thickness (up to 2 mm thick).
- Implied texture: smooth surface on the dome, rough reflection on water due to color blending.
- Pattern size: brushstroke pattern with a period of 5 px creating an impressionistic effect. 

This structured approach allows for clear reproduction of the artwork's characteristics across various subjects.
