### Form

- Central object: single dome, fully three-dimensional, opaque.
- Surrounding structures: four tall, slender cylinders (minarets), fully three-dimensional, opaque.
- Base structure: large rectangle, fully three-dimensional, opaque.
- Water reflection: elongated rectangle, 2-D outline, smooth edges.
- Shrub shapes: multiple tall, thin irregular organic blobs, 3-D volumes, opaque.

### Composition

- Layout type: asymmetrical.
- Primary focal point: center at 50% width, 60% height (the dome).
- Balance method: heavier bottom with dome and base, lighter top with sky.
- Directional flow: Z-shaped reading path from bottom left to top right and back down to bottom right.
- Negative space: approximately 40% of the frame, around the dome and the reflecting pool.

### Material

- Medium: digital illustration.
- Surface feel: smooth, with slight digital brush texture.
- Visible artefacts: minimal, clean lines, no pixelation.

### Technique

- Application style: flat vector fill with layered shading.
- Precision level: highly precise.
- Special process: none noted.

### Color

- Background: gradient of light blue to pale yellow at the top (sky).
- Dome: cream with hints of light gold.
- Minarets: pale stone color, consistent with dome.
- Base structure: beige with darker accents for details.
- Reflection: mirrored colors of the sky and structures in the water.
- Shrubs: deep green for the foliage, contrasting with the base colors.

### Line

- Line types: continuous.
- Weight: medium (3-5 px).
- Function: outline contour of structures and shapes, internal detail in the archways.
- Direction: vertical for minarets, horizontal for the base and water line.

### Perspective

- Perspective type: two-point perspective.
- Vanishing points: one located beyond the left edge, the other beyond the right edge of the frame.
- Degree of foreshortening on key objects: minarets slightly shortened in height as they recede.
- Horizon line height: approximately 40% of the frame height.

### Space

- Depth range: moderate (~1 m impression).
- Spatial continuity: uninterrupted view to the dome and structures, with reflections in the water.
- Viewer position: eye-level.

### Proportion

- Dome height = 1:3 of full building height.
- Minarets = 1:2 height of dome.
- Base structure = 1:4 height of full structure.

### Scale

- Overall canvas size: 60 cm × 90 cm.
- Relative scale of main subject: dome fills approximately 30% height of canvas.
- Scale: human-scale (relatable to viewer).

### Texture

- Real texture: smooth digital finish with no physical texture.
- Implied texture: smooth surface on the dome and structures, representing polished stone.
- Pattern size: no visible patterns, but smooth transitions in shading.
