### Form

The artwork contains a variety of shapes. The primary shape is a rectangular café terrace on the left, which has a three-dimensional quality and is opaque. There are multiple round tables with three-dimensional volume and opaque solidity. A series of irregular organic shapes represent people at the café. The distant buildings form a combination of three-dimensional rectangles and irregular shapes. Edge quality ranges from sharp straight edges defining the buildings to softly rounded edges for the trees and figures.

### Composition

The layout is asymmetrical. The primary focal point is the brightly lit café terrace, located left-center at about 30% width and 50% height. The composition uses a balance of heavier left elements contrasting with darker, lighter elements on the right. The directional flow leads the viewer’s eye from the café terrace down the cobblestone street towards the dark, linear perspective of buildings on the right. Negative space is minimized, with tightly composed elements covering most of the canvas.

### Material

The medium is oil paint on canvas. The surface quality appears textured, with visible brush strokes creating a slightly rough, impasto effect.

### Technique

The artist uses a thick impasto application style with layered blends for depth. The precision is loose and gestural, indicating a focus on expressiveness rather than detailed realism.

### Color

The café terrace is painted in warm yellows and orange, creating a stark contrast with the cooler blues and blacks of the night sky and surrounding buildings. Chairs and tables feature shades of brown and orange, enhancing the warmth of the terrace. People figures are in dark tones, with hints of whites and yellows where necessary. The sky is a deep blue with soft, white-yellow stars scattered throughout. The lower section features cobblestones in blue and ochre, echoing the night sky’s tone and tying the scene together.

### Line

The painting utilizes continuous lines with varying weights. Thin to medium outlines define the buildings and terrace features. Lines guide the viewer’s eye along the terrace’s awning and down the cobblestone street, while vertical lines articulate the buildings and windows.

### Perspective

The perspective is a two-point perspective, with vanishing points situated off the canvas to the left and right. There is moderate foreshortening of the café and tables extending into the street, with diminishing size towards the background. The horizon line is low, around 20% of the canvas height.

### Space

The spatial impression is deep, with a perception of over 5 meters from the foreground terrace to the back of the street. The space is continuous and uninterrupted, with a clear transition from the café to the street and background buildings. The viewer’s position is at eye-level, creating an immersive atmosphere.

### Proportion

Human figures are small in comparison to the architecture, approximately 1:8 of the canvas height, contributing to the sense of vastness and perspective. Proportions remain naturalistic rather than idealized.

### Scale

The physical size of the artwork is significant, contributing to an immersive human-scale feeling. The main subject, the café, occupies around 60% of the canvas width and height, making it the dominant focus.

### Texture

The real texture of the surface includes raised paint, roughly 2 mm thick in places, with brush strokes indicating the cobblestone texture and sky’s swirling effect. This adds tactile richness and visual interest to the scene.
