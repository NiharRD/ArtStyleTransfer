was born on December 12, 1863, in Norway—into a world already shadowed by illness, grief, and the early deaths of those I loved. These experiences carved themselves into my psyche, shaping my understanding of existence as a fragile dance with suffering. From my earliest years, I felt enveloped by an immense shadow of existential dread; the anguish I carried did not merely surround my life—it became the very essence of my creative journey.

Under the influence of the nihilist Hans Jæger, I embraced a bohemian life dedicated to unfiltered emotional honesty. He urged me toward what he called “soul painting,” and I soon realized that art would be my instrument for confronting the psychological storms that raged within me. Impressionism, though beautiful, felt insufficient—too concerned with fleeting external light, not the deeper, darker contours of the mind. Only through expressive distortion and the clash of violent, vibrant colors could I begin to give shape to my inner torment.

My artistic evolution was nourished by figures like Gauguin, van Gogh, and Toulouse-Lautrec, whose bold colors and daring departures from realism deepened my understanding of expressive power. Yet my path diverged further still. I came to embrace Expressionism, where subjective emotional truth eclipsed naturalistic representation. My forms became distorted, my lines urgent, my hues—reds, oranges, bruised blues—reflected alarm, despair, and the turbulence of human consciousness.

The Scream emerged from this philosophy. The skeletal figure—with its wide-open mouth, trembling contours, and the sky swirling in reds and oranges above the darkening fjord—stands as a distilled image of universal angst. On that bridge in Kristiania, I felt the world shudder; nature itself seemed to scream. In the painting, the bridge—so often a motif in my work—signifies transition, a tenuous border between stability and chaos. The figure’s terror is both deeply personal and entirely human, a metaphysical scream echoing across time.

Throughout my career, I sought to render internal realities visible. The solidity of form clashed against the fluidity of emotional upheaval; the distorted head and elongated shapes of my figures conveyed not anatomy, but psychic truth. The vigorous brushstrokes, layered and gestural, created textured surfaces that mirrored the rough terrain of the soul. I wanted my paintings to challenge viewers to confront their own anxieties, as I confronted mine, urging them to peer into the same abyss that shaped me.

Painting became my confession, my introspection—a visceral narrative of panic, longing, mortality, and the perpetual search for meaning within the maelstrom of life. My figures, often no more than echoes or silhouettes, embodied the monumental static of emotion rather than the fleeting nature of physical reality. In choosing distortion over accuracy, I rebelled against tradition in pursuit of raw emotional truth.

Critics often met my work with both condemnation and acclaim; yet triumph, for me, was found in the moments when viewers felt the weight of my scream and recognized it as their own. This was my aim: a universal catharsis born from deeply personal suffering.

In this unholy narrative of existence, my art became both testament and shelter—a paradoxical blend of despair and hope. Even amid controversy, madness, and darkness, I relinquished nothing. For all that is unsettling in my work, I believe it is deeply, irrevocably human.
